* Lists
** Autofocus inline editing fields
   I tried looking into this. I think I know how to do it with normal <input> tags, but I don't know how to do it with b-inputs.
** Remember stuff when using the browser back button
** Tags
   Requires back-end work
*** Plus corresponding interface, search &c
** Some kind of query builder for the AFS
   Probably out of scope for the initial release.
** Make all the list controls actually work
   Need to figure out how to make it work with the vuex store.
** Make rendering faster (for when pagination is off)
** Per episode information?
   Probably out of scope for the initial releasej
   Would be nice to at least be able to do stuff like:
*** Marking which episodes you've seen
*** Comments on individual episodes
*** Scores for individual episodes
** Change default sorting to "score" 

* Dashboard
** Make navigation actually work properly
*** Make vertical tabs look good
    Kinda like the is-toggle class, though that doesn't work for how it's currently set up
*** Integrate second layer of tabs in the list interface in the top tab bar
    If there's space
    Hard to do because of nuxt-child and shit.
*** Correctly set active class on tabs
*** Add redirects for things like /dashboard and /dashboard/list
** Fix "add anime" interface
*** Make it use the search 
*** Add some separation between the two columns
*** Fix the code duplication in the edit form
** Fix recs page
*** Make it look good
    Table?
*** Implement for different lists
*** Add some settings/controls
** Implement missing pages
   
* Profile
** Implement missing parts
   
* Settings
** Add more settings
** Search through settings
   
* Library
** Pictures update
** Make left column bigger (?)
** Better search
*** Allow exact matches

* General
** Remove (or at least change) focus halo
** Remove animation on opening modal, and remove little "x" on the top right
