\question[12] 
Let $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$ be an alphabet. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item List the elements of $L_1$, the language consisting of all strings in $\Sigma^*$ that are palindromes and have length less than or equal to four. 
\item List the elements of $L_2$, the language consisting of all strings in $\Sigma^*$ of length less than or equal to three in which all $a$'s appear to the left of all $b$'s.
\end{enumerate}

\question[12]  Use mathematical induction to prove the following statement:\\

\emph{Suppose real numbers $a$ and $b$, such that 
$$
A = 
 \begin{pmatrix}
a & 0 \\
0 & b
 \end{pmatrix}
$$
Then, for every positive integer $n$, it holds: 
$$
A^n = 
 \begin{pmatrix}
a^n & 0 \\
0 & b^n
 \end{pmatrix}
$$

\question[12] 
Ten people volunteer for a three-person committee:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 
How many three-person committees can be formed from the 10 volunteers? 
\item 
Assume that every possible committee of three that can be formed from these ten names is written on a slip of paper, one slip for each possible committee, and the slips are put in ten hats. Show that at least one hat contains 12 or more slips of paper.

\question[12] Consider the sequences of integers whose first six elements are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item 
$3,6,12,24,48,96, \ldots$
\item 
$2,16,54,128,250, 432, \ldots$
\end{enumerate}

In each case:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 
Find an explicit formula that generates the elements of each sequence.
\item 
Check that your formula is correct by finding the next three elements of the sequence.

by $$a_n = -8a_{n-1} -16a_{n-2}$$
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Find an explicit formula for the sequence defined by $a_n$, with  
$a_1 = \alpha$ and $a_2 = \beta$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are two given constants.
