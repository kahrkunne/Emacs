** Demographics
This may of course not be entirely accurate, but I think all sites are big enough that it is fairly accurate.
- Anidb is notably less male-dominated than other sites
- Anidb is overrepresented in college-educated users, but has the least graduate school level users.
- Anidb users are notably older, being higher than the internet average in 25-34 year olds. Anidb has the most users in 35-44 and 45-54 age ranges, but is then underrepresented for older users, compared to the other two sites.
