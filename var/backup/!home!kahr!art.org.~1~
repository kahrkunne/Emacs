Fans of a something will frequently single out a part of that thing and mark it as "bad", and then dismiss all criticism of the thing as a whole as only applying to the "bad part". For example, fans of shounen anime will sometimes single out a few shounen series - say, Naruto and Fairy Tail - and deflect all criticisms of shounen anime in general to these shows. 

This happens at all scales, from individual franchises to anime in general. Another great example of this is people hating on "moeshit" and loli: they'll single out some genres of anime and blame all criticisms of anime in general (such as rampant sexualisation and infantilisation) on these few works. This way, they have a generalised defense against any criticism of anime as a whole: "this is not applicable to the shows I watch".

Essentially, this is a defense mechanism that comes from a feeling of insecurity about your taste. It comes from the same emotional space as the idea of "guilty pleasures", namely that it's not okay to like (or even be associated with!) certain things. And in a way, disavowing some things in this manner is a great way to cope with this insecurity. You can essentially deny any connection with the things people are being critical about.

However, there's also a fatal downside to this approach: it's a breeding ground for taboos. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if this is *the* prime mechanism through which taboos arise, at least regarding taste. Basically what ends up happening is that people start collectively disavowing something. This makes it even more taboo to like that thing, which makes people disavow it even more, and the cycle continues. 

Aside from the bigger socialogical problems with this, such as eventually splitting a community and creating a counter culture, these taboos cause a lot of personal insecurity. Eventually, they turn taste itself into a minefield where you have to be very careful not to like the wrong things, lest you appear "uncool". This situation is a lot like stereotypical high school bullying, where the bullies themselves are the ones who are the most insecure.

So what this comes down to is that it's important to think before you speak. Don't fall for the trap of being guilt-tripped into disavowing something you really don't have a strong opinion about. In the end, there's no value in having "cool" anime tastes, but there is a lot of value in keeping a healthy sphere of discourse. 

** DONE How Higurashi utilizes its medium to make you uncomfortable 
Higurashi no Naku Koro ni has some of the best horror in otaku culture. A classic, Higurashi has managed to attain long-term fame and popularity dispite its low production values. I'd like to focus on the first chapter of the visual novel, "Onikakushi-hen", to show how Higurashi conveys its horror.

Onikakushi-hen follows the typical VN structure: it starts out peacefully, until a dramatic event happens; then the story goes into a more dramatic arc. The beginning of the story shows our main character, Keiichi, making new friends in a rural atmosphere reminiscent of something like Non Non Biyori. This arc is well done, and made me feel at ease; I constantly had a smile on my face while reading it. By itself, however, this arc is nothing special; the majority of visual novels will start in a similar manner, as it is a genre convention.

The genius of Higurashi is how the story enters its second arc. A typical VN would have a big, dramatic event occur here, impacting the plot. Higurashi, instead, opts to make subtle changes to its delivery through brilliant usage of its medium, while keeping the actual events in the story "normal", or at least more ambiguous.

The main cause of horror in Onikakushi is estrangement: the story spends its first arc building up comfortable friendships, only to estrange the main character from his friends afterwards. It does so in three ways: first of all, the style of the dialogue changes. For example, characters will start implying they know things that they shouldn't, or their tone will suddenly become a lot more negative. The effect is that Keiichi's friends start to feel fake. This also works retroactively; you realise that a lot more has been going on "behind the scenes" in the story; a kind of dramatic irony. This results in a feeling of betrayal and confusion.

The VN combines the changes in dialogue with well-timed audio effects and subtle sprite changes. Most notably, the eyes of characters will sometimes change to look cold and harsh when impactful lines are delivered. This has a strong psychological effect; I'm not ashamed to admit that at times I was almost afraid to advance the text because it's such an unpleasant sight.

Higurashi also utilizes its medium by controlling reading speed. It'll occasionally force a pause in advancing the dialogue, for example when a dramatic line is about to be delivered. This allows Higurashi a level of control over the timing of things that is rarely seen in written media; and good timing is exactly what's essential for horror.

Finally, there is another way Higurashi uses its medium: by breaking its conventions. As I've mentioned, visual novels have a set structure. Notably, they're usually divided into two parts, an introductory part and an emotional part. A fan of visual novels will come to expect this division; and that expectation is what Higurashi abuses. Onikakushi never quite launches into an intense emotional arc; there is no single dramatic event that changes the story. Because of this, the reader always has a sense of anticipation; a feeling that something dramatic could happen any moment.

Combined, these techniques inspire a strong paranoia in both the reader and the main character. Yet they don't change the content of the interactions much; as a result, there's always a plausible deniability. Keiichi is never quite sure whether anything abnormal is even happening; and because the main character is an unreliable narrator, this effect extends to the reader as well. The end result is an almost schizophrenic estrangement, where you feel like you can trust nobody; not even yourself. 

Subtle horror is the most sophisticated horror, and Higurashi uses its medium perfectly to achieve it. The Onikakushi chapter is a great example of how to use the capabilities the medium of visual novels offers to offer a unique user experience.

If you have any thoughts on the subject or if you know any other visual novels with this property be sure to tell me in the comments, and if you enjoyed the video make sure to share it so others can enjoy it as well.

** Genres are a useless distinction
Genres are one of the most common ways to partition works of culture in. Yet they give so little practical information as to be useless. 

Thinking about it in the context of anime, how often have you actually decided to watch something based on genre? Chances are it's not very often; I certainly haven't. This is because a genre neither tells you something about the content of an anime, nor tells you anything about its quality.

To give an example: the mahjong anime Saki is tagged on MyAnimeList with genres "Game, School, Slice of Life". Yet watching Saki is like watching a yuri sports anime. Normal school life plays next to no role in the show, and its appeal is completely different from Slice of Life anime like k-on.

Similarly, a show's genre won't tell you if you will like it or not. Genres paint in broad, arbitrary strokes. You might like some genres better than others, but there are probably no genres you won't watch on principle. 

Rather than genres, we should be using more meaningful things to distinguish anime. One of them is creators; despite what some people say, I still think which studio created it tells us a lot about anime. We probably all have a good idea of the differences between a Kyoto Animation and a Bones series, for example. 

An even better criterium would be a show's director, but that requires

** Why there are no good western VNs: fans versus producers in culture creation
The west has seen a sudden boom in visual novels as of recently. While not all of these are terrible, none live up to the Japanese standard. What is causing this dramatic difference in quality?

People often will cite "production values" as the reason behind this difference in quality. While it is true that Japanese VNs almost universally have higher production values than western VNs, this does not seem to be decisive for quality. You don't have to look very far to find examples of great eastern VNs with abysmal production values; for example, Tsukihime and Higurashi spring to mind.

Rather, most western VN developers don't get the core appeal of VNs right. I have discussed the core appeal of VNs in another video, so I won't get into that here. Instead I'll focus on the reason why western developers don't "get" VNs: the west has very few otaku. 

To illustrate what I mean, I'll compare Japanese and western creators. In Japan, the industry is full of otaku, as has been famously commented on by Hayao Miyazaki. This is true of VNs even more than of anime. In Japan, VN creators are typically passionate fans of VNs. They get into creating because they want to create more of what they love.

Contrast that with the west, where VN creators care more about the process of creating than about what they create. Western VN developers usually aren't the most passionate VN fans; they often haven't read all the classics, and have only a tenuous grasp on genre conventions.

** Why the Fate/Stay Night visual novel is worth reading
The Fate franchise is iconic. Its influence on otaku culture is hard to overstate; its also huge, and there's no indication it will stop growing any time soon. 

Yet Fate is also contentious. The original work in the Fate franchise, Fate/Stay Night, is a visual novel which is longer than the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy. With the wealth in adaptations, many fans don't feel inclined to read the visual novel; often to the dismay of other fans, who see the visual novel as the apex of the medium.

Even more vexing are people who try the anime, don't like it, and then refuse to read the novel. Of course, this is an understandable reaction, with a work as long as Fate/Stay Night. Still, I will make a case for why you should give the novel a try, regardless of whether you enjoyed or even watched the anime.

** On the skill of taste
So I'd like to talk a bit about "taste". "taste" is something that we all intuitively understand, but that's hard to really define properly - we all know what we mean when we talk about our own or someone else's taste, but what *is* taste? In a way, we can see taste as a kind of ranking in how aesthetically pleasing something is; for example, my "taste" might be that I prefer baroque architecture over modern architecture. This is how taste manifests outwardly, and how other people perceive our taste. Inwardly, we can see taste as a way of "comparing" things: we could picture a metaphorical "taste machine", where we input two things and it outputs which of the two we like better. Of course, this doesn't fundamentally explain what taste is; there's still the black box of the "taste machine". However, for the sake of this essay, that is irrelevant: I'll leave the question of what makes things aesthetically pleasing to philosophers.

Specifically, I'd like to talk about the concept of "good taste", the idea that some people's taste is somehow better than that of other people. This is a pretty divisive idea: some people would argue that taste is completely subjective, because it is based on no objective criteria. Other people might argue that taste is in many ways shared between people; most people would agree, at least in a basic sense, what is beautiful and what is not. If most people independently agree on something, there could very well be some objective measure at work. Lastly, there's also people who simply use "good taste" to mean "taste that is similar to mine"; for the sake of this essay, I'll ignore these people, because I don't see how that definition of good taste could ever be useful.

Personally, I do think there is such a thing as "good taste", but I don't agree with most people who believe in it. From my experience, most people who believe in "good taste" only look at the outward aspect: they consider two people as having the same taste when they agree on a ranking of things. I think this is an error; there is more to taste than just how it appears to other people.

The thing with taste is that it appears simple outwardly: you can see a person as a machine to which you can input a bunch of "things", after which people output a ranking of these things based on how much they like them. If you could theoretically ask them to rank all comparable "things", they would produce a simple, deterministic ranking of these things, and that would be their taste. While this is what taste looks like how we deal with it in day-to-day life, what's actually going on inside is a lot more complex. The real taste is not the outcome, but the criteria on which that outcome is decided; it is not the black box itself that is the taste, but what goes on inside. For example, one person might just like everything with bright colours, whereas another person has a keen sense for colour composition. Their opinions could coincidentally match up, and they could rank things the same way; but it would be an error to say their taste was the same. After all, their thought processes are completely different! Similarly, it's not hard to imagine that one of these people could have "better" taste than the other. In fact, I can almost guarantee that you, the reader, have already formed an opinion on which of the two has better taste; and I bet you and I agree on that!

Up until now I've been speaking mostly in vague terms; referring to "rankings" of "things". Because I feel like this vagueness will make it harder to understand, I'll start explaining in the context of Japanese animation, or anime, both because this is the context in which I first conceived of this article and because the issue of "taste" is one of constant debate in the anime community.

With anime specifically, it's hard to tell if there's such a thing as "good taste". There are some anime that clearly suggest the existence of bad taste; these are typically anime that are very popular, especially with people who are new to anime or simply have not seen a lot of it. These anime are also typically not liked, or at least considered overrated, by people who have seen more anime and have deeper knowledge of the medium. These anime are relatively few in number, but infamous; any person at least moderately interested in anime will probably have instantly thought of /Sword Art Online/ at this description. However, some of these shows (though typically not SAO, it'd be better to think of something like /One Piece/ here) are enjoyed by some minority of the "more experienced" anime viewers, and some shows considered mediocre or even downright bad by most people (including experienced viewers) are also enjoyed by some enthusiasts.

As you can see, you can't easily tell whether good taste exists from this situation; on one hand, you can in some ways draw a very clear divide in taste between new and experienced viewers; this would suggest a qualitative difference in taste. On the other hand, this divide is not ubiquitous; people with ostensibly "good" taste might still enjoy "bad" shows. If there really is a bigger idea of "good taste", why would it affect some shows but not others?

I think the explanation to this can be found in the fact that we should consider "taste" (and therefore "opinions") as more than just black-and-white. While it might seem that the anime newbie who thinks popular mainstream things are the best thing ever made and the experienced anime viewer who likes some mainstream shows a lot have the same taste, this is not the case. The most important clue here is in the fact that one is a newbie and one is experienced; the newbie is very likely to love everything they come accross, simply because people love new things. The fact that people love new things is also easily explained, because people always measure how much they "like" something in relation to other things; we ourselves have defined "taste" as being some sort of "ranking" or system of comparison in this very article! Everybody knows the feeling of discovering a new thing for the first time; at first, it feels unlike anything you've seen before. As you become more experienced in whatever it is you're doing or consuming, you start to realize that the first thing you got into wasn't actually *that* good. 

I think from here on out it's important to only consider taste in a specific domain; I will continue to use anime as an example, but this should translate to any other "domain", which consists of things which can be reasonably compared based on aesthetic quality (which is a necessity for "taste" to exist, keeping in mind that we define taste as some method of comparing things). It's easy to see why we need to do this when we start considering taste as something that is learned or acquired; obviously watching a lot of anime isn't going to develop one's taste in architecture, for example.

In the last paragraph I already gave what is according to me the answer of the taste problem: taste is something that is learned. What defines good taste is not the results, the "ranking", that come out of it, but the fact that this ranking was based on careful, though potentially subliminal, consideration. In the case of anime, the beginning viewer might fall in love with the things that make anime different from what they're used to, for example the way it deals more liberally with death, it's high action and it's vibrant colours. These are things that are easy to see on first sight, without prior knowledge of a "canon" of anime. A more experienced viewer on the other hand might start to appreciate composition, animation quality and quality of writing, things which are hard to appreciate without a broader perspective. While the newbie and the experienced viewer might reach the same conclusion if they had to rank things, there is a big qualitative difference in their taste: the experienced viewer would be able to understand why the newbie liked what they liked, but the inverse would not be true. The experienced viewer would not only have a deeper understanding of the material, but also a deeper understanding of themselves in relation to this material; they would not only notice things the newbie wouldn't because they have a bigger "mental library" to compare to, but they would also be better at describing for themselves why they liked something. 

I think the latter is a satisfactory definition of "good taste"; the ability to understand and express *why* you like something. This can only be done in relation to other, comparable things. After all, we can only define taste in terms of comparison. In a way, we can see good taste as being an increasing level of taste-in-taste: someone with bad taste might only be able to tell that they liked show A better than show B, a person with better taste would also be able to tell that they liked, for example, the animation in show A better than most shows they've watched (i.e. "they thought it was good"). A person with even better taste would also be able to compare sub-qualities of this animation, for example background and foreground animation, or action versus non-action animation. Another necessity is the ability to determine how much each "part" of a series matters to oneself; after all, your opinion of the entire series is a weighted average of its parts.

This definition of good taste maintains that taste is subjective; after all, "good taste" means nothing other than having a better understanding of your own subjective experience. This definition allows for people with good taste to disagree on things, while also providing a clear metric of how good one's taste is: their ability to understand why they like things. Further more, in my experience it mirrors our preconception of taste: people we consider to have good taste, including experienced viewers and critics, typically fit this definition of good taste well; newbies almost never do.

A side-effect of this definition of good taste is that taste can be trained; it is not some vague innate property that you either do or do not have, but it is something that is acquired with experience. The first step to acquiring good taste would be to consume a lot of material; in the case of anime, it would be to watch a lot of shows. But after a certain point, that won't be enough; it's also necessary to actually think about what you're watching, and question yourself: "Why do I like this? What do I like about this? Why do I like this better than that?". I think this would, in principle, be enough to acquire good taste. I don't think it's necessary to study the actual "parts" of what you're judging, in this case for example the art of animation, to acquire good taste; after all, taste is a matter of introspection. I do think studying these things could help, mainly because they could give food for thought. In the same vein, I do believe that there's value in studying the creators of something; if you tend to enjoy things made by a particular creator, it's a logical next step to think "What is it about this creator that I like? What's the common theme in all these works?". 

In the end, this is the definition of "good taste" that I use. I would like it if other people adopted this definition as well; I hate seeing "You just have bad taste" thrown around as an ad hominem in a discussion without any explanation of what that means, and I also hate hearing "Taste is subjective, there's no such thing as good taste", because I feel like that ignores this whole, in my opinion important, aspect of enjoying things. This definition of good taste allows us to build more objective arguments around it. Of course, I don't think this definition of taste is objective; there's no objective way to measure how well someone understands themself. Nevertheless, I think that it's not something that people would really disagree upon; after all, with this determining the quality of one's taste comes down to just asking them to explain their opinion and then judging their arguments; and contrary to popular belief, I think that people are actually pretty good at telling a good argument from a bad one.

Of course, I don't want to encourage people to take this definition of "good taste" and use it to be an elitist prick; though people already do that with whatever meagre definitions of "good taste" they can find. The most common being liking a specific set of things; be wary of anyone who, when asked to list their top n favourite anime, puts /Mushishi/, /Ghost in the Shell/, /Tatami Galaxy/ and some Satoshi Kon thing all in the same list. All of these are of course great shows, but putting all of these in the same list is indicative of someone trying to seem more intelligent than they are. I don't think this is particularly a problem with my definition of "good taste", but still. Also, take care not to bully people for not having good taste. Though I say "good" taste, it's more a matter of being invested in something; you can't really blame someone for not being as into something as you are. I would prefer the term "developed taste", but I would rather hijack the (currently useless) term "good taste" than create a new term that most people wouldn't understand. 

So in conclusion, taste is fundamentally an understanding of the self; taste is domain-specific and doesn't really translate well into other media; and taste is something that can be learned and developed. I would encourage any readers to take this last point into account when consuming media. I haven't devoted any particular attention to what makes good taste "good", but it's safe to say that having better taste improves the consumption experience. It'll clear your mind up, make it easier to discuss with other fans and will help you find other things you'll like. Oh, and also: analysing yourself is just a lot of fun!

ujj** F up on "On the skill of taste" by means of an analysis of Rewrite
So recently I wrote an essay about taste, where I discussed how taste, like someone's taste in music or movies, is not an innate trait but rather a skill that you can exercise and improve in. Of course, this also means that there is such a thing as "good taste. I defined "good taste" as being able to understand your own opinion; to understand not just *if* you like something, but also *why* you like something, and what parts of it you like. Today I want to do a follow-up on that post, giving an example of where I personally found my taste lacking, as well as going a bit more in-depth on how the process of forming an opinion works.

Let's get right into a case where I found my taste lacking: the 2011 visual novel *Rewrite*, by Key. Rewrite is a VN that I found difficult to form an opinion on; that's what I mean with "I found my taste lacking". If pressed on the issue I would say that I did like Rewrite - at the very least it was engaging enough to make me finish the entire 70-hour thing - however I don't think I could write a review on Rewrite, or defend my opinion adequately against someone who hated it. This to me is the hallmark of bad taste: being unable to formulate and/or defend your opinion.

So why do I find Rewrite so difficult to critique? First of all, Rewrite is **long**. With VNs, getting a time estimate is always difficult, because I never time how long it takes me to read something and everybody reads in their own speed, but I think that ~70 hours for full story completion wouldn't be too far off the mark. Furthermore, the quality varies a lot, both between routes as well as in routes themselves. Rewrite contains some really good moments, but it also has plenty of boring or downright bad moments. 

These things make it hard to form an opinion about Rewrite; it's not that hard to form an opinion of individual moments or scenes, but it's hard to average the entire thing into one opinion. To really explain how this works, we have to go a little more in-depth on how I think an opinion, the smallest unit of taste, works. Basically, how I see an opinion is like a tree. For Rewrite, a simplified form of this tree might look like this:
![The "taste tree" of Rewrite]({{ site.url }}/assets/taste_tree.png)

What this means is that your opinion or Rewrite as a whole is a weighted average of all its nodes; in this example, my opinion of Rewrite as a whole depends on my opinion of its writing, its music and its art. Each of these things are then once again weighted averages of other things. How I see it, forming an opinion is a three step process: first, you break the bigger "thing" down into smaller parts. Next, you form an opinion of each of these smaller parts. Lastly, you take the weighted average of each of these smaller parts - this is your final result. As you can see, the second step makes this a recursive process; and like any recursive algorithm, this one too must terminate on an edge condition. In this case, you're going to reach a point where you have to form an opinion on something while not being able to break it down any further. These situations are the leaf nodes of the tree; in the above example they're named as "individual moments". The way you form an opinion on things which you can't break down is by comparing it to other things from memory. Basically, you compare it to similar things you remember, and compare how much "good" it is. Basically what you're doing is taking this little piece, and comparing it to similar pieces in other things you've enjoyed in the past. I'm not really sure what you'd be comparing them on; I don't think it's enjoyment, because in practice these pieces are probably too small to meaningfully say how much you enjoyed them. Also, while this step sounds subjective, in practice it is not. It seems like if you take a sufficiently small part of something, the majority of people will agree on how "good" it is. Why this is, is an enigma to me; I encourage readers to share their theories with me. 
The last step is taking the weighted average of these parts. The "weight" you give to these parts is what makes opinions so subjective: it's a measure of what's important to *you*. While people will generally agree on how "good" each individual part is (for sufficiently small parts), how important this actually is differs from person to person. In the case of anime, some people find colour design to be very important; others might mostly care for the plot.
One important thing to keep in mind is that most of the time, these things will happen subconsciously; most of the time, we're not going through these steps consciously. The way I reconstructed these steps is by looking at how people describe their opinion: it's customary for critics to break down their opinion in such tree structures. Usually this happens implicitly, but sometimes critics also do this explicitly, by giving each node a score out of 10, then giving the whole thing they are reviewing a score out of 10 too. 

Now that we know how an opinion is formed, we can have a closer look at the skill of taste. If taste is the art of forming an opinion, and forming an opinion can be broken down into three steps, then the skill of taste is also the skill of these three steps. Let's go through each of these steps and take a look at what makes someone "good" at them.

First of all, one must be good at breaking something down into smaller pieces. This is the aspect of the skill of taste which can be most easily trained. This skill is a measure of how well you understand the medium, and I think it's the most obvious way to distinguish a newbie consumer from an experienced consumer. In anime, for example, a beginner might only be able to divide something up into vague, basic components such as "visual quality", "music quality" and "quality of writing". An experienced consumer would consider a bigger, more clearly defined set of components: what the beginner refers to as "visual quality" might be subdivided into animation fluiditiy, fight choreography, colour direction, composition, *etc*. This is also the part of taste that can be most easily acquired; while most people will acquire this skill passively through watching a lot, you can also train this actively. You could for example do this by reading or watching good critique, which might touch upon components you never noticed. You could also study the production of whatever you're consuming, as most if not all of these components are actively constructed. You could take this one step further and actually create something similar to what you're consuming. Outwardly, being good at this aspect of taste manifests as being able to analyze something. Someone good at this will typically give off an air of really knowing what they're talking about, whereas someone who isn't will typically feel inexperienced. This is the most technical aspect of taste. It's also the part of taste that best carries over to other media: while what makes good writing in anime might be somewhat different from what makes good writing in a book, the difference is not that big. They do both need to have a good plot (if applicable), good dialogue, good prose, *etc*.

The second aspect of taste is being able to form an opinion on the smallest parts. This part is the hardest to learn, and it seems to be in large part innate to all people. There is some things that have an influence on this part: culture seems to be a big one, because it in part defines what e.g. "good writing" is to you. Another one is how much you have consumed. What really matters here is how much something is "different" from other things in a medium: some experimental work might show you something that breaks the "rules", but is still good. In that regard, we can consider this part of taste the "rules" of what makes something good. If you wanted to train this part, the way to do it would be to keep an open mind, and consume unorthodox media. In practice, how useful that is, is questionable; by definition most works don't break the "rules", after all. Of course, I'm writing this from the point of view of a consumer; a creator might be really interested in developing this part of their taste so that they can create works that stand out more.

The final aspect of taste is the most personal one. This is where the "knowing yourself" part of taste comes in. Like all parts of taste, this part is passively acquired by consuming things; however, just mindlessly consuming won't develop this part. What really develops this part is thought: by thinking about how you feel about something, you'll discover what matters to *you*. Writing critique is also a way to develop this part, because critiquing something is just a more intense form of thinking about something. Discussing something with others accomplishes the same goal, with the added benefit of hearing the opinion of others. Similarly, reading critique might inspire you to do the neccessary thought. In practice, this aspect manifests itself as the ability to explain and defend your opinion. After all, this is the part that explains *why* you like something. This is also the part of taste that develops the fastest in the beginning, which is why newbies to a medium seem to regularly change their opinion drastically. 

Now that we know what skills you need to be able to form a good opinion, we can return to Rewrite and see why it is so hard to critique. Rewrite doesn't break any "rules", it is not avant-garde or particularly innovative. Therefore, the second aspect of the skill of taste is not a problem with Rewrite. The first aspect isn't particularly difficult either; though Rewrite is long, which means that it breaks down into many leaves, it's not particularly difficult to dissect. A hallmark of works which are difficult to dissect is that they are difficult to understand, i.e. dense or complicated; Rewrite is not.
Therefore, what makes Rewrite difficult to critique must be the third aspect. And indeed, this is the case: Rewrite is plagued by dramatic shifts in quality. In one work, Rewrite contains both great and terrible moments. The music ranges from great to subpar, the background art ranges from very good to horrible, the writing ranges from exciting and engaging to boring and repetitive. To really form an opinion on Rewrite as whole, you have to weigh these great and terrible moments against eachother. This is what I struggle with when forming an opinion of Rewrite: it's easy for me to break Rewrite down into it's individual components and say what I think about these components, but it's hard to say what this means for Rewrite as a whole. 

Of course, Rewrite is just one of three ways in which something can be difficult to form an opinion on. The difficulty in critiquing Rewrite is in the third aspect; there's equivalents for the first and second aspects. The first aspect, for example, would be difficult for something which is dense or complicated. Generally, fi you have trouble understanding what's going on, it's probably related to difficulty in the first aspect. Another way in which things can be difficult in the first aspect is by having elements that are foreign to you; an example would be foods that you have to "learn" to enjoy, such as olives or coffee. Personally, I had this sensation with root beer; to this day I still can't tell whether I liked it or not, but I did end up pouring it down the drain (and I haven't had any since then). 
As I've already mentioned, something can be difficult in the third aspect by breaking "the rules", by defying our expectations. Avant-garde works would fall into this category.

In closing, we've seen the tree structure that's the root of all opinions. We've seen the recursive three-step process by which we form opinions, and we've seen a practical example of why something might be difficult to form an opinion on.
I encourage all readers to try and apply the principles I talked about today to their personal lives. Does this model adequately explain why you find some things difficult to form an opinion on? Is it useful for improving your own taste?

Cheers,

Smith
** On the usage of jargon and when to adopt foreign idiom
For us to discuss anything, we need words. And specific topics often require specific words; we call this jargon. Jargon and neologisms are very powerful tools, because they allow us to express complicated concepts in little information: they are a form of compression. However, they are not without cost: to be able to use jargon, every person involved has to know the jargon. This means that there's a big "up front" cost for discussing certain topics: you must learn all the jargon before you can partake.

Therefore, there exists a balance between having so little jargon that it's difficult to talk about something, and having so much jargon that it's difficult to start talking about something. In context of my field of expertise: in the anime community, and the "otaku" community in general, a lot of jargon is used. It's not uncommon to be barraged by terms like "tsundere", "moe", "JK" and so on. Some of this jargon is blatantly unnecessary: "JK" just means "high school girl", and there's no real reason to use a different term. Meanwhile a term like "moe" is far more complicated; whole books have been written exploring the topic. If a whole book is needed to explain what "moe" is, then naturally one would invent a unique word to reference it by. 

The trouble is this: how does one find this delicate balance? To those in the "in-group", all nuance is exposed. They have no trouble understanding how a "tsundere" is more than just a "mean girl". They also know all the jargon; they are not burdened by learning it. On the other hand, people just getting into the hobby will are confronted with many terms they don't understand, which might drive them away from the hobby. They would prefer there be less jargon, so that they can get to discussing their new hobby more quickly, with a lower up-front cost.

While I understand the frustrations of those new to the hobby, I am of the opinion that jargon is typically good. Where something can be expressed fully without jargon, such as saying "anime porn" instead of "hentai" (which is an erronous usage of "hentai" anyways), the English terminology should be used. However, if a concept can't be completely expressed in standard English, it is better to invent jargon than to use a less-nuanced English term. 

This places a lot of the cost up-front, but benefits speakers down the line. Using the English term would help beginners, but the lost nuance would cause problems both in discussion and in understanding down the line. And correcting these problems is often harder than it would've been to just learn the jargon up-front. It's not that hard to learn the meaning of a new word; it's much harder to correct a misunderstanding. 

This sentiment extends to adopting a foreign word. After all, foreign words are a kind of jargon of their own: they're jargon for the speakers of that language. A language typically has certain concepts that another language doesn't. This is especially important when translating: there's a balance between accurately communicating what is being said, and using concepts that the reader is familiar with. Now, a lot of the time when a foreign concept is not translated, this is just lazy translating. After all, it is a translator's job to communicate the meaning of something in a different language; leaving words untranslated is a failure to do this. Nevertheless, sometimes it's better not to translate something, if translating it can't be done without losing a lot of nuance. 

One thing that matters a lot here is the target audience. For some target audiences, it's unacceptable to expect them to just "learn the jargon". This is especially the case with things like movies meant for mainstream appeal: they should be translated so that everyone can watch them. However, in certain cases, it's perfectly justified to expect consumers to learn the jargon. The most prominent example is hobbyists: they are, by definition, going to spend a lot of time on something. They are not the casual audience; they are in this for the long haul, so they're going to want to learn the jargon. Too often do I see translators insist on not using native words or jargon of any kind, because the notion they have of "good translation" dictates it. Even if the target audience is almost universally people who are going to spend tens, hundreds or even thousands of hours on something. 

This can cause some real problems at times. For example, in the English-speaking riichi mahjong community, there's essentially two different "languages": one where people mostly use the original Japanese words, and one where people use a weird hybrid between English and Chinese. The terms in the second "language" are typically far more unwieldy and complicated than the ones in the first: what's called "sanshoku" in Japanese is called "mixed triple chow" in the English/Chinese hybrid. In this case, just the terminology is ugly; no meaning is lost. There's far worse examples: I've seen "pinfu" be called "all-chow hand", which loses a lot of meaning. In this case, the new term is actively harmful; while the old term was just difficult to understand, the new term is blatantly misleading. 

The consequence of this is that it's difficult for mahjong players to communicate. Intermediate players might not understand eachother's language, while new players might learn a weird mixture of terms and barely be able to express themselves. An added negative is that while the Japanese terms are (or at least, could be) international, the English terms aren't, meaning they often have to be translated again into the native language of a player. 

In conclusion, we've seen why and when it's justified to use jargon and foreign words. Words are key not just to what we can speak about, but also what we can think about. While I agree that accessibility trumps nuance for the casual consumer, it's different for the real hobbyist. Using the most accurate, nuanced terms is essential to good discussion and good thinking in the long term.

*** How to enjoy visual novels series 
<2017-04-12 Wed>
I think it's necessary that someone does a full walkthrough of visual novels. I would start by covering what visual novels are, both their essence (i.e. literature) and how they are categorized. That naturally leads into the main reason why people don't enjoy visual novels: their expectations are wrong. I'll try and educate people on what they should expect.

This can (and, perhaps, should) be worked out to a full youtube series on visual novels. Fits well with the theme of The Fringe Element. Good start-up series.

** Humans and optimizing variables
<2017-04-11 Tue>
Humans are pretty good at optimizing one variable, but exponentially worse at optimizing multiple variables. This is part of the reason why capitalism works while communism doesn't: capitalism tries to maximize only profits while communism tries to maximize the broader concept of "well-being". Capitalism works because profit correlates positively with well-being at a large scale. Maximizing profits is easy; all you have to do is make one number go up. The problem with capitalism is that it doesn't target well-being directly, and the correlation between profit and well-being isn't that strong. There's also plenty of ways to make a profit which do not help or even harm well-being.

Communism, or other authoritarian economic systems for that matter, try to target well-being directly. This is difficult, however, as well-being is a complicated concept composed of many variables. Humans are incapable of balancing all these variables.

Another way to look at this is that fsimple systems are better than complicated systems. Any system with more than one variable is evidently very hard for humans to understand. 
** Subjectivity of time
<2017-04-12 Wed>
Of all human senses, time is one of the most essential yet also one of the least trustworthy. Our sense of time isn't constant but rather varies a lot: some things seem to take a long time, while others seem to take very little.

Aside from the obvious factors like enjoyment, I think that expectations play a big role in how long something seems to take. This would explain why, for example, top of the line computers never really feel slow; yet ten years in the future it's hard to imagine people were ever okay with using such slow systems. Our standard for how long something should take strongly influences how long we feel it takes; another way to look at it is to say that time is always measured relative to something.

I think this topic warrants some more pondering

** Humans and time pressure
<2017-04-12 Wed>
Humans don't work well under time pressure. For example, I find it hard to write things knowing that I have to be finished writing 40 minutes from now on, even if it's very unlikely I'll need that much time.

What we observe is a paradoxal effect where the less time we feel we have, the longer we'll take doing something. This might be one of the biggest problems for humanity in the current age, where time constraints are among the most common constraints.

*** TODO Ponder a solution
** Deciding
<2017-04-12 Wed>
Humans have the ability to do something which I call "Deciding". Humans aren't good at accomplishing goals; however, in very rare circumstances humans can Decide to attain a goal. Deciding to do something fills a person with an almost limitless amount of willpower; giving up becomes impossible, as the human mind will break and you will go crazy before you give up.

Of course, Deciding isn't easy. It requires an almost godly amount of dedication; you can only Decide if you want something deep enough that you'd be willing to do that anything to accomplish it, even if it means doing something you hate for 15 hours a day while living in horrible circumstances. Deciding is also necessary for things like giving your life for your country (or suicide terrorism, it's the same principle).

Yet even though Deciding requires a strong desire and dedication to be present, it's not a consequence of them; it's a conscious decision. That is, you can be in a position where you can Decide to do something, but don't. Typically doing this manifests in a lifetime of regret, though. 

It's not hard to see these Decisions in reality; we probably see them more often than we think. Any time somebody decides to give up everything and to absolutely give their all at any cost, we see a Decision. This could be anything from tapping out of society and becoming a poor traveller to being a starving artist to giving everything up for love. 

Despite this, I think people typically don't Decide when they can. I base this on how many people there are with the kind of life-altering scar of regret that not Deciding leaves.

As for the origin of Deciding, it might be evolutionary. I can definitely see how Deciding could make someone a more attractive mate. If this is evolutionary, we'd expect to see this kind of high risk high reward strategy more often in males than in females; and indeed we do. Further research would be required to confirm this theory, though.
** Humans and low skill levels
<2017-04-13 Thu>
Most people are very bad at most things. This includes even common, useful and simple skills like making conversation. 

The reason for this is that we don't deliberately practice most things. By putting in even a small amount of deliberate practice, you can get in the top ten percent of people in many skills. Doing so is good practice; practice has diminishing returns, so it's worth while to practice many things a little bit (but less worth while to practice few things a lot).
* Fiction
** Lost in transit
<2017-04-11 Tue>
A book set in a future where space travel is mainstream and humans live in space. Teleportation technology is starting to become available to the public, but it isn't perfect yet. On rare occasions, items being teleported will end up in a different location than their destination; these items are said to be "lost in transit".

The main character decides to quit his job and move to a region of space which was previously inaccessible to his civilization, but has now become reachable through the use of teleportation. He brings his lover with him, planning to get married on the other side. 

The woman has some issues with teleportation at first, as she is unsure if they'll still be the same people once teleported. Nevertheless, she decides to follow the main character. The two teleport, and the main character starts his life on the other side. However, the two quickly start to grow apart; after a while the woman decides to end their relationship. She tells the main character that she hasn't loved him since teleporting; her love was "lost in transit".

This drives the main character mad. His dream of building a future with this woman was crushed. He starts to neglect his job and health, and gets fired. At the climax of his hopelessness, he makes one final gamble: he'll travel the universe to find her love and bring it back to her.

To do this, he becomes what is called a "scavenger". Scavengers are people who explore the universe and look for space junk or items which were lost in transit. While not outlaws per se, scavengers find themselves on the fringes of society, and bear a social status similar to that of petty criminals and beggars. By becoming a scavenger, the main character gives up his relatively high social status as well as any option to regain it in the future.

The other scavengers, however, don't accept the main character as one of their own. They see him as a lunatic.

** Void magic 
A world where reality exists as data within "The Void", an ethereal concept where everything exists. Magic is done by writing to the Void directly, and can therefore bypass the laws of physics. Data in the void can exist in two forms, either as immutable data or as a reference to data elsewhere in the void.

As an example, one can think of a fireball. To summon a fireball, you can do two things; first off, you can write the data for a fireball into the Void (presumably at a specific location and with a specific velocity). Doing so would, quite simply, create a ball of fire somewhere. Another way to do it would to write a reference to your /idea/ of a fireball in the Void. This would be inextricably linked to your mind; the fireball will be exactly like you imagine it, and will change accordingly if your mind changes. As a result, you can, for example, freely move the fireball around (by changing its velocity with your mind).

The first method, called Writing by Value, is easier to do, but takes more energy initially. It's also less flexible. The second method, called Writing by Reference, takes little energy up-front, but takes continuous energy as long as the fireball exists. It also requires continual focus. These two make it impractical to use in the case of a fireball.

The aforementioned Reference can be anything, as long as it is properly Understood. Things from fiction, for example, are not excluded; if one properly Understands a myth, one can create magic related to that myth. It will match the myth exactly, but it will also change as the myth changes (the myth here being dependent on how people view it).
