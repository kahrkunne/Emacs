Comparing MAL, kitsu, ANN, anidb, anime-planet, CR, vndb, anilist and shikimori
* Comparisons of sites
** Traffic
Data is for the US, but should be universally applicable. This is per month.
*** Visitors
MAL: 7.6m
Anidb: 331k 
A-P: 1.9m
*** Visits 
MAL: 29.9m (3.9 per visitor)
Anidb: 600k (1.8 per visitor)
A-P: 3.9m (2 per visitor)
*** Pageviews
MAL: 144m (18.9 per visitor, 4.8 per visit)
Anidb: 2m (6 per visitor, 3.3 per visit)
A-P: 16.1m (8.5 per visitor, 4.1 per visit)

** Demographics
This may of course not be entirely accurate, but I think all sites are big enough that it is fairly accurate.
- Anidb is notably less male-dominated than other sites
- Anidb is overrepresented in college-educated users, but has the least graduate school level users.
- Anidb users are notably older, being higher than the internet average in 25-34 year olds. Anidb has the most users in 35-44 and 45-54 age ranges, but is then underrepresented for older users, compared to the other two sites.
