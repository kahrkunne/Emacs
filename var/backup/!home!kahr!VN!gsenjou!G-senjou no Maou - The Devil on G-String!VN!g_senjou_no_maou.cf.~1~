; *DO NOT EDIT* this file unless you are understanding what you are doing.
; FYI:
;  Each line consists of NAME="VALUE" pair, VALUE is a series of
;  \xNN, where NN is hexadecimal representation of UNICODE codepoint.
;  For example, opt="\x61\x62\x63\x3042\x3044\x3046" means that the
;  value of options "opt" is alphabets a, b, and c followed by Japanese
;  Hiraganas A, I, and U.
;  DO NOT PUT non-escaped value like opt="abc". This doesn't work and should
;  be like opt="\x61\x62\x63".
